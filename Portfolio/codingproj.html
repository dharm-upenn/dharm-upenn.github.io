It includes a variety of components such as a GameBoy console, animated card flip, clap animation, and a vibrant post-it note section. The design incorporates GIF overlays, typewriter text animations, and interactive elements like hover effects and active states to create an immersive experience. With a blend of nostalgic aesthetics and modern CSS techniques, this showcase demonstrates creativity in presenting a blend of interactive retro-themed elements using HTML and CSS." data-image="codingproj1.gif" data-response="" data-link="https://codepen.io/Dharm-Doshi/pen/WNLjRqq?editors=1100">Interactive Retro-themed CSS Showcase</li>

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="Explore the Matrix Puzzle Art - an interactive and intriguing HTML/CSS project that presents a grid of draggable elements forming artistic images. The project showcases a collection of puzzle pieces represented as draggable blocks that, when rearranged, reveal hidden images. Engage with this visually stimulating creation, experimenting with the draggable elements to unlock and uncover mesmerizing artworks within the grid. Challenge yourself by piecing together the puzzle to reveal various cat-themed compositions, each adding an element of surprise and creativity. Dive into the Matrix Puzzle Art, where manipulation meets creativity, offering an immersive and engaging experience." data-image="NvL.gif" data-link="https://dharm-upenn.github.io/Puzzle/index.html">Matrix Puzzle Art: Interactive Grid of Draggable Elements</li>

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="The 'Time-Driven Bubble Visualizer' is a JavaScript project employing the p5.js library to create an animated canvas filled with moving bubbles. These bubbles dynamically change in both shape and color, resulting in an evolving visual experience.

          Each bubble is unique, varying in size, speed, and initial color, contributing to the visual diversity. The display is influenced by the system time: minutes dictate color shifts between red and blue hues every alternate minute, while hours toggle bubbles between circular and square shapes.
          
          As time progresses, the bubbles gracefully traverse the canvas in accordance with the system time, creating a dynamic and visually engaging display that continuously evolves. This visualizer offers an artistic representation of time through an interactive and captivating display of animated bubbles." data-image="proj6.gif" data-link="https://editor.p5js.org/dharm-upenn/sketches/2fP2uqqST">Time-Driven Dynamic Shape and Color-Shifting Visualizer</li>

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="This project creates an interactive canvas where users can input text and dynamically paint it across the screen by moving the mouse. As the user moves the mouse while holding down the left button, the entered text gradually appears, following the movement path. The size and color of the text change based on the distance between the current and previous mouse positions, providing a dynamic and creative text painting experience. With each stroke, the text adapts its size and color, resulting in a visually appealing and ever-evolving artwork. Explore the canvas, experiment with different texts, and witness your creations come to life with this interactive text painting application." data-image="proj3.gif" data-link="https://dharm-upenn.github.io/Section3Assg3/index.html">Interactive Text Painting: Mouse-Controlled Canvas Text Generator</li>

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="'Face Mask Detection System using OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow' is a robust project leveraging Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts to identify face masks in images and real-time video streams. It employs MobileNetV2 architecture for computational efficiency, making it deployable on embedded systems like Raspberry Pi and Google Coral. With an accuracy of 98%, this system is pivotal for ensuring public safety in various settings such as airports, offices, and public areas amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The absence of morphed masked images in its dataset underscores its accuracy and real-world applicability. This project's contributions are welcomed, fostering advancements in safety technology during these challenging times." data-image="proj7.gif" data-link="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1llz3r_nYPorDmo3XgIvCk0bHBbZ8-VQD?usp=drive_link">Face Mask Detection System using OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow</li>

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="This coding project focuses on designing a robust Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to enhance cybersecurity in the digital landscape. Leveraging both signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques, this study proposes a comprehensive approach to identify known threats through signature patterns while detecting new anomalies in network traffic. Employing a blend of Random Forest, Light GBM classification models, and autoencoders trained on regular packets, the project preprocesses the CICID2017 dataset, reduces its dimensions, and evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed Hybrid-IDS design. Integration of Snort3, Redis, and Elastic Stack enhances the system's capabilities, providing a powerful defense mechanism against cyberattacks." data-image="proj8.gif" data-link="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-3758-5_36">Hybrid Intrusion Detection System Using Autoencoders and Snort</li>

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="The Smart Parking Reservation System is a web-based application featuring distinct user and admin modules. It streamlines parking slot management, allowing users to check available slots, book spaces, make payments, and receive confirmation messages. For admins, the system grants complete database control, enabling slot modifications, addition of vehicle categories, and detailed transaction analysis between specified dates. This project alleviates parking-related stress, particularly in congested cities like Mumbai, optimizing the parking experience for users and enhancing vehicle management capabilities for administrators." data-image="proj9.gif" data-link="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1llz3r_nYPorDmo3XgIvCk0bHBbZ8-VQD?usp=drive_link">Smart Parking Reservation System</li>
