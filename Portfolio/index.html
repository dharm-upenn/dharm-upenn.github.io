                    <a href="reading.html" target="_self" class="left">For me, Ulises Carrión's Mail Art concept flips the idea of traditional art on its head. Instead of focusing on things like aesthetics or technique, he emphasizes that art is about interaction and communication. He says we can't just count how many people like an artwork; we have to dig deeper and understand how it connects with people emotionally and intellectually. Carrión also talks about art that doesn't need clear answers, which challenges our usual ideas about art. In today's digital world, where we can all be artists and critics, his ideas encourage us to be creative, open-minded, and collaborative in how we make and appreciate art.

Her emphasis on metaphor and reimagining the internet's structure challenges conventional thinking, inviting us to view the web in new and inspiring ways. It's a reminder that we all have a role to play in making the internet a more interesting and useful place. Édouard U. discusses how people learn and build knowledge networks. It basically encourages us to learn in our own unique way and be open to new ideas, which is important in today's world with so much information available.

What truly piques my academic interest is the ingenious concept of themed neighborhoods within Geocities, with designations like "SoHo" catering to artists, "Heartland" catering to family and pet enthusiasts, "The Tropics" whisking away users to travel utopias, and even "The Pentagon" providing an online haven for military personnel. It's interesting how these theme divide, giving the virtual communities a distinct personality and flavor. However, it's somewhat disheartening that Geocities gradually earned a reputation for somewhat amateurish web design and not being the epitome of refined taste. Nonetheless, the quirky charm of Geocities adds an intriguing layer to its narrative! The prevalence of animated GIFs, with the iconic Felix the Cat taking center stage, exemplifies the whimsy of the era. Moreover, the creative freedom expressed through unique webpage section dividers, ranging from dripping blood lines to barbed wire in "The Pentagon" neighborhood, speaks to the unconventional and imaginative spirit of Geocities users.

The document delves into two of Frenkel's pieces, "String Games" and the "Body Missing" website, highlighting how she employs technology to probe the boundaries of the image and the role of the screen. What intrigued me most was Frenkel's ability to create conceptual containers for the future, anticipating their filling by the past. Her work imparts fresh meanings and resonance to elements of new media art, offering a critical reinterpretation that challenges our perception of the screen as a phantasmagoric archival repository. This perspective underscores the intricate nature of memory in the digital realm, adding a layer of complexity to our understanding of this evolving field.

                    <a href="reading.html" target="_self" class="left">One standout point for me was the exploration of trust issues associated with bots and algorithmic media. It's fascinating to ponder whether we can genuinely trust the face or voice of a bot, and how this potential for deception might shape our perceptions and judgments. These ethical considerations in our tech-driven era are crucial and raise important questions. Another aspect that truly caught my attention was the challenge of archiving bots and algorithmic media. It's not merely about storing them; the emphasis on truly understanding and interrupting their flow is intriguing. This challenges the traditional notion of archiving in the digital age and how we can capture the essence of these ever-evolving forms of media.
