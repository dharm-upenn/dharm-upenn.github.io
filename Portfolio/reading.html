          <li class="reading-item" data-response="For me, Ulises Carrión's Mail Art concept flips the idea of traditional art on its head. Instead of focusing on things like aesthetics or technique, he emphasizes that art is about interaction and communication. He says we can't just count how many people like an artwork; we have to dig deeper and understand how it connects with people emotionally and intellectually. Carrión also talks about art that doesn't need clear answers, which challenges our usual ideas about art. In today's digital world, where we can all be artists and critics, his ideas encourage us to be creative, open-minded, and collaborative in how we make and appreciate art." data-image="image1.jpg">Ulises Carrión - Mail Art and the Big Monster from Second Thoughts</li>

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="I think Schwulst's essay is a call to action for people to be creative and take control of their own little part of the internet, to move beyond passive consumption (social media platforms) to become creators and innovators in the digital realm. She wants us to see the internet in a new way and not just rely on big companies. Her emphasis on metaphor and reimagining the internet's structure challenges conventional thinking, inviting us to view the web in new and inspiring ways. It's a reminder that we all have a role to play in making the internet a more interesting and useful place.

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="This text dives into how publishing is going through a big makeover. It talks about how print and digital worlds are coming together to create something fresh and innovative! Think of it like taking your favorite book and adding interactive features that change or adapt as you read. It's not just about making regular books anymore; it's about making books that can do all sorts of cool things! And who's leading the charge? The new generation, the digital natives who grew up with all this tech stuff, underscoring the significance of generational perspectives in sculpting the future of publishing. They're the ones pushing the boundaries of what publishing can be. So, it's like a super exciting journey in the world of publishing, and publishers need to be open to new ideas to keep up with the changes!" data-image="image3.jpg">Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer - Selections from Publishing from Post-Digital-Print</li>

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="Geocities emerges as a fascinating web hosting platform, evoking an era where users could wield their creative prowess to craft personalized websites that knew no bounds! What truly piques my academic interest is the ingenious concept of themed neighborhoods within Geocities, with designations like 'SoHo' catering to artists, 'Heartland' catering to family and pet enthusiasts, 'The Tropics' whisking away users to travel utopias, and even 'The Pentagon' providing an online haven for military personnel. It's interesting how these theme divide, giving the virtual communities a distinct personality and flavor. However, it's somewhat disheartening that Geocities gradually earned a reputation for somewhat amateurish web design and not being the epitome of refined taste.

          Nonetheless, the quirky charm of Geocities adds an intriguing layer to its narrative! The prevalence of animated GIFs, with the iconic Felix the Cat taking center stage, exemplifies the whimsy of the era. Moreover, the creative freedom expressed through unique webpage section dividers, ranging from dripping blood lines to barbed wire in 'The Pentagon' neighborhood, speaks to the unconventional and imaginative spirit of Geocities users." data-image="image4.jpg">Olia Lialina - STILL THERE Ruins and Templates of Geocities from Lost and Living (in) Archives</li>

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="It's truly fascinating to consider how Duchamp's inquiry has the power to revolutionize our understanding of artistic expression! His daring question challenges the very boundaries that confine art, liberating artists to embark on unconventional journeys of creativity. This profound inquiry encourages us to reevaluate the rigid criteria and contexts traditionally associated with art, thus opening up exciting avenues for experimental artistic pursuits." data-image="image5.jpg">Seth Price - Dispersion</li>

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="One fascinating aspect of the 'Alt-Text as Poetry' workbook is its strong emphasis on artist involvement in the description of their own work. It truly celebrates the artist's pivotal role in this process, recognizing the distinct perspective they bring to the table. This approach transforms the act of description from a mere accessory into an intrinsic part of the creative masterpiece." data-image="image6.png">Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan - Selections from Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook</li>

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="The incorporation of Disney iconography into hypermodern graphic design emerges as a captivating trend. Designers now wield Disney references as potent signifiers imbued with profound meanings. This transition from physical to digital surfaces, fueled by the internet's influence, reshapes the display and interpretation of signs, offering new dimensions to visual communication. Moreover, the use of Disney imagery as a tool for critique and irony in the context of copyright disputes adds complexity to this artistic landscape. It's a fascinating exploration of how graphic design evolves and adapts within the ever-changing digital age, where Disney's cultural lexicon takes on multifaceted roles beyond mere aesthetics." data-image="image7.jpg">Ben Duvall - Selections from New Modernism(s)</li>

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="The discussion on technology for cross-cultural learning and understanding among children highlights the challenge of language, cultural representation, and the need for a more inclusive approach. It addresses the linguistic dominance of English in technology, the importance of diversity in design teams, and the necessity of facilitating cross-cultural communication. This prompts us to rethink the inclusivity of our digital world and the role of technology in fostering cultural understanding. In conclusion, the document provides essential insights for a more diverse and inclusive approach to educational technology." data-image="image8.jpg">Ramsey Nasser - "A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures" from Decolonising the Digital</li>

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="I was captivated by the exploration of artist Vera Frenkel's integration of technology into her works, particularly in the context of absence, memory, and archival repositories. The document delves into two of Frenkel's pieces, 'String Games' and the 'Body Missing' website, highlighting how she employs technology to probe the boundaries of the image and the role of the screen. What intrigued me most was Frenkel's ability to create conceptual containers for the future, anticipating their filling by the past. Her work imparts fresh meanings and resonance to elements of new media art, offering a critical reinterpretation that challenges our perception of the screen as a phantasmagoric archival repository. This perspective underscores the intricate nature of memory in the digital realm, adding a layer of complexity to our understanding of this evolving field." data-image="image9.png">Dot Tuer - Beyond the New Media Frame The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel’s String Games</li>

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="One standout point for me was the exploration of trust issues associated with bots and algorithmic media. It's fascinating to ponder whether we can genuinely trust the face or voice of a bot, and how this potential for deception might shape our perceptions and judgments. These ethical considerations in our tech-driven era are crucial and raise important questions.

          Another aspect that truly caught my attention was the challenge of archiving bots and algorithmic media. It's not merely about storing them; the emphasis on truly understanding and interrupting their flow is intriguing. This challenges the traditional notion of archiving in the digital age and how we can capture the essence of these ever-evolving forms of media." data-image="image10.jpg">Paul Soulellis - Performing the Feed</li>

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="The discussion around the master/slave relationship in technology really caught my attention due to its interesting parallels with historical events, especially the transatlantic slave trade. The document did a great job shedding light on the power dynamics and how they echo in modern tech. Gem's experiences with technology were quite relatable, and it was interesting to see how her interactions highlighted broader societal issues. Overall, it's fascinating how Gem's tech encounters mirror historical patterns, making it a thought-provoking read." data-image="image11.png">Neta Bomani & Sabii Borno - Beyond Dark Matter from Logic Issue 15 Beacons</li>

          <li class="reading-item" data-response="In 'Why Games Or Can Art Workers Think,'' the most intriguing aspects for me revolves around art's autonomy, the concept of 'crapstraction,'' and the impactful connection between art and activism. The discussion on art's autonomy challenges conventional beliefs, exploring whether art truly exists independently of social influences. 'Crapstraction,' highlighting patterns from randomness, stretches across economics, social analysis, and questions the reliability of these emerging patterns. The merging of art and activism showcases the potent role art plays in fueling societal changes." data-image="image12.jpg">Hito Steyerl - Why Games Or Can Art Workers Think</li>
